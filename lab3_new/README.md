<!-- # Lab 3

Try to build an even-number detector classifier for the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset from Scikit-Learn. You can use either binary classifer or multi-classifier.

Use lab3.py as baseline and [How to load MINIST Dataset](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/data/loadlocal_mnist/) -->

# Lab 3 - Classification

[Pima Indian Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database?select=diabetes.csv) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Question

- Can we predict the diabetes status of a patient given their health measurements? Build a classifer and calculate Confusion matrix with

* True Positives (TP): we correctly predicted that they do have diabetes
* True Negatives (TN): we correctly predicted that they don't have diabetes
* False Positives (FP): we incorrectly predicted that they do have diabetes (a "Type I error")
* False Negatives (FN): we incorrectly predicted that they don't have diabetes (a "Type II error")
